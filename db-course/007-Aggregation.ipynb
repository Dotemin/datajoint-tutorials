    "1. Aggregation functions with no `GROUP BY` clause produce 1 row. \n",
    "2. Aggregation functions combined with a `GROUP BY` clause. The unique key of the result is composed of the columns of the `GROUP BY` clause.\n",
    "3. Most common pattern: `JOIN` or `LEFT JOIN` of a table pair in a one-to-many relationship, grouped by the primary key of the left table. This aggregates the right entity set with respect to the left entity set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that MySQL with the default settings allows mixing aggregated and non-aggregated values (See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_only_full_group_by). So you have to watch avoid invalid mixes of values.\n",

    "3. Do not mix aggregated and non-aggregated values in the result with or without a `GROUP BY`.\n",
